##Controls:
	The distance from your mouse cursor to the center of the cue ball is the power.
	The direction from your mouse cursor to the center of the cue ball is your direction.
	If you press the space bar, the cue ball will be 'hit' with the direction and power of the shot.
	Your mouse is tracked outside of the window incase you want to hit really powerful shots.
	This was done so that the user can choose to be very accurate or very powerful.
